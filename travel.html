    <h3>Welcome</h3>
    <p> Welcome to my travel diary! Although my international travel has slowed over the past few years,
    I have grand plans to explore new places in the next several years and have enjoyed traveling domestically quite a bit this past year.
    See below for past and future travel adventures.</p>

    <h3>Past</h3>

    <h4>Riyadh, Saudi Arabia</h4>
    <img class="image2" width="300" src="Riyadh map.png">
    <p>I was born in Riyadh, lived there until age 3, and had the chance to visit again at age 7.</p>
    <p>When visiting at an older age, my favorite aspect was the food!</p>

    <h3>Present (In the Past Year)</h3>

    <h4>Costa Rica</h4>
    <img class="image2" width="300" src="Costa Rica.JPG">
    <p>I had the chance to visit Costa Rica with my fiance in March 2015.
    We participated in an adventure day featuring horse-back riding on a mountain, a water slide on a mountain, and zip-lining.</p>
    <p>The trip was paid for entirely through points! <em>(Thank you, former Consulting career!)</em></p>

    <h4>San Francisco</h4>
    <img class="image2" width="300" src="San Fran.JPG">
    <p>I took a quick trip this year to San Francisco for work.
    I also had the chance to visit my brother, who recently moved there.</p>
    <p>The trip featured two red-eyes in two days!</p>

    <h4>Naples (Florida)</h4>
    <img class="image2" width="300" src="Naples.JPG">
    <p>My last trip of 2015 was to Naples, Florida, to visit my mom over the New Year's Eve holiday.</p>
    <p>My favorite part was relaxing on the beach for 3 days straight!</p>

    <h3>Future</h3>

    <h4>Lebanon</h4>
    <img class="image2" width="300" src="Beirut.jpg">
    <p>My dream vacation would be to Beirut, Lebanon, where my father grew up.</p>
    <p>I hear the beaches are beautiful!</p>
